# CS 193 Lab 2 - Unix Commands
The purpose of this lab is to teach the basics of using the terminal. After you finish this lab, you will be able to manipulate files on any UNIX-like machine (including your Purdue CS account)!

Before starting the lab, you might want to check out the [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/ssagheer532/CS193-Labs/blob/master/Lab2/cheat-sheet.md) to review all the common commands. 


### Folder Structure 
Below is the folder structure that is generated from running the script command. As you can see, there are some problems. For example, ma261 is in the computer science folder instead of the math folder. Throughout this lab, you will write terminal commands that fix these mistakes.
